# Implementing Decision Tree Algorithm from scratch

The purpose of the tutorial is to implement step-by-step a Decision Tree
algorithm from scratch using both ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) and CART
(Classification And Regression Tree) algorithms.

As we code along, we will dive more in deepth in each algorithms.
Most of the code in made in the DecisionTree.py file at the root of the
project.

In order to test our models, we will use the Titanic dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
